# WiFi-weather-station-App
My first Android app, which connects to Arduino with various weather sensors.

This Android App was made for AGH University "High-level programming languages" course. Its main task is to parse weather data (such as temperature, humidity, air pressure) from remote WeMos D1 Arduino module and compare it with openweathermap.org "Weather API" data.

To find out more about the weather station unit itself (WeMos D1 one) - go to my [WiFi-weather-station-SensorUnit](https://github.com/kubala887/WiFi-weather-station-SensorUnit) repository.
